# Red Horse Constructors Non-Sewered Waste Water Processor Design
## Non-sewered waste water treatment systems: design, construction, operation, and assessment

<img src="https://circleci.com/gh/jupyter/jupyter-book.svg?style=svg" class="left">

This is a working document to bring together global research and development of non-piped wastewater treatment facilities with engineered field experiments conducted by the Human Needs Project in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya and San Rafael, California.

We will build analytical models of each system available today, and compare and contrast design models. Then, with an ever-increasing amount of field data, we will maintain an on-going comparison of actual field performance, incorporating actual capital and operating expense data.

All designs and products should comply with international standards: [International Organization for Standardization 30500](https://www.iso.org/standard/72523.html),
