Data Science applied to Wastewater Engineering
====================

## Data Science
- drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data
sets through exploration, prediction, and inference.

## Wastewater Data Science
- utilizes analytic knowledge,
encapsulated in methods of numerical linear algebra and differential equations, and
empirical data, captured from operating waste water treatment systems, to build and refine
models of actual operating systems.

Exploration depends upon rapid visualization, coupled with  descriptive statistics drawn from data sets.

Prediction depends on executing models of the systems, coupled with machine learning techniques applied to actual data sets to calibrate the analytics.  Optimization techiques are applied in this adaptive model.
