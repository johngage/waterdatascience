Design of Distributed Water Treatment Systems Since 2010
-------------------

- Minimum Volume, Energy, Cost, Water Use

- Leading Institutions

The Gates Foundation Toilet initiative has supported hundreds of researchers and research
institutions to develop technologies appropriate for urban slums and rural farms.
[Gates Foundation Toilet Expo 2018](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2018/11/Bill-Gates-Launches-Reinvented-Toilet-Expo-Showcasing-New-Pathogen-Killing-Sanitation-Products)

Each academic project has been strongly encouraged to create a commercial component, to move toward global volume.

Today's commercial products include:

- China (Clear, CRRC, EcoSan)
- United States (Sedron Technologies)
- India (Eram Scientific, Ankur Scientific, Tide Technocrats)
- Thailand (SCG Chemicals)
- Japan (LIXIL)

Twenty reinvented toilet and omni-processor technologies and products rooted in the foundationâ€™s portfolio of investments are now available for commercial licencing and production.

New international standards: [International Organization for Standardization 30500](https://www.iso.org/standard/72523.html), define the operational requirements for the reinvented toilet, as well as other existing and future stand-alone, non-sewered sanitation technologies.
